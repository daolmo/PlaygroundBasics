//: ## Calculations
//: You can use a playground like a calculator. Type in the math problem you want solved and the results sidebar shows the answer, or the _result_, of the calculation.
//:
//: You can use the plus `+` and minus `-` signs for addition and subtraction, just as you’d expect:
343 + 560 + 230

1000 - 999.9999999999999

(738 * ((73 * 623) + 839483)) / 35
//: For multiplication, use the asterisk `*` :
3 * 7
//: For division, use the slash `/` :
2.3424 / 8
//: For grouping, use parenthesis `( )` :
(3000 + 500 + 400) / 3
//: - experiment:\
//: Practice using the playground like a calculator.
//: Edit some of the existing expressions and add a few of your own.
//: Notice that every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.
//:
//: Next, learn how programmers can leave notes in code.
